### Create a template to detect airline experience

From the following text, determine whether the customer had a positive or negative experience.
If it is negative, identify whether the cause was the airline's fault (e.g., lost luggage) or beyond the airline's control (e.g., a weather-related delay).

You may only respond with one of the following:
1. Positive experience
2. Negative experience caused by the airline's fault
3. Negative experience beyond the airline's control

Do not provide any response other than these three options.
